                <h3>I’m sure you’ve heard how important STEM is. You’ve also probably heard 
                    that people with STEM careers typically do pretty well financially. 
                    But what you might not have heard is what STEM actually is.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Getting a definition for STEM is easy enough: it stands for Science, Technology,
                    Engineering, and Math. So take a biology class in college, and technically
                    you're taking a class that’s a part of STEM. However, STEM is much more
                    than just a useful way of grouping subjects in a catchy acronym.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At its core, STEM is a teaching philosophy that integrates all 
                    four disciplines together into a single, cross-disciplinary program 
                    which offers instruction in real-world (as opposed to purely academic)
                    applications and teaching methods.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is important to understand because getting a math degree doesn’t 
                    necessarily mean you completed a STEM program, even if math is a STEM subject.
                     Without the integration of all four disciplines and the use of real-world 
                    teaching methods, you don’t get the educational benefits that make STEM degrees 
                    so valuable and careers in STEM fields so desirable.</h3>

                <h4>STEM is pretty different. And, like, really difficult.</h4>
                <div class="h4para">Don’t worry if you’re still a little confused about all this. STEM is a 
                    <br>complicated idea to wrap your head around. It might be easier to fully
                    understand <br>how STEM subjects become a STEM program if you knew what a 
                    college-level<br> STEM program actually looks like for a student.
                </div>
                <h5>
                    STEM is extra heavy on science and math.
                </h5>
                <div class="h5para1">
                    Science and math are particularly 
                    important in STEM because technology <br>
                    and engineering are dependant on 
                    them. If an Architectural Engineering 
                    <br>student needed to design a 10-story
                    building, they would first need to 
                    understand the underlying mathematical
                    and scientific principles that make
                    a building like this possible. STEM
                    careers share this heavy reliance 
                    on either math or science—often both. 
                </div>
                <div class="h5para2">However, this doesn’t mean that 
                    STEM is <br>beyond reach if you’ve 
                    struggled with<br> these subjects in 
                    the past. It just means <br>that STEM 
                    will likely be more difficult <br>for
                    you than others. Alternatively, 
                    you<br> might find that understanding
                    these two <br>subjects is actually 
                    easier for you than <br>it has been in 
                    the past, given the <br>practical way
                    these subjects are taught <br>in a 
                    STEM program.</div>

            According to a<br> report by the website
            STEMconnector.org, by 2018,<br>  projections
            estimate the need for 8.65 million<br>  workers
            in STEM-related jobs. The<br>  manufacturing
            sector faces an alarmingly<br>  large shortage
            of employees with the necessary<br> 
           skills — nearly 600,000. The<br> field of
            cloud computing alone will have created 
           1.7 million jobs between<br> 2011 and 2015,
            according to the report. The<br> U.S. Bureau 
           of Labor Statistics projects that by 2018,
            the bulk<br> of STEM careers will be:--</div>

            Computing – 71 percent<br>
Traditional Engineering – 16 percent<br>
Physical sciences – 7 percent<br>
Life sciences – 4 percent<br>
Mathematics – 2 percent<br>
STEM jobs do not all require higher education or even a college degree. Less<br>
 than half of entry-level STEM jobs require a bachelor's degree or higher.<br>
  However, a four-year degree is incredibly helpful with salary — the average<br>
   advertised starting salary for entry-level STEM jobs with a bachelor's<br>
    requirement was 26 percent higher than jobs in the non-STEM fields, according to<br>
     the STEMconnect report. For every job posting for a bachelor's degree recipient<br>
      in a non-STEM field, there were 2.5 entry-level job postings for a bachelor's<br>
       degree recipient in a STEM field.

This is not a problem unique to the United States. In the United Kingdom, the<br>
 Royal Academy of Engineering reports that the Brits will have to graduate<br>
  100,000 STEM majors every year until 2020 just to meet demand. According to the<br>
   report, Germany has a shortage of 210,000 workers in the mathematics, computer<br>
    science, natural science and technology disciplines.
